# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

Yocto/OpenEmbedded build for **Tessaro**, a web kiosk, producing Linux images
for the platforms it ships on. Derivative of
[Moonforge](https://moonforgelinux.org/).

Obsidian tracking: no

## Commands

Use the mise tasks rather than calling `kas-container` directly:

| Task | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `mise run build` | Build the image and OVMF firmware |
| `mise run shell` | Interactive kas shell (cwd is the build dir) |
| `mise run unpack` | Decompress the `.wic` for runqemu |
| `mise run run` | Boot in QEMU, serial console on the terminal |
| `mise run run-vnc` | Boot in QEMU with VNC on localhost:5900 |
| `mise run clean` | Drop build artifacts, keep sstate and downloads |

Exit the QEMU serial console with `Ctrl-a x`.

There is no test suite or linter; correctness is "the image builds and boots".
For work on a single recipe, go through the kas shell so bitbake sees the right
environment:

```sh
mise run shell                          # then, inside (cwd is /build):
bitbake -e <recipe> | grep '^VAR='      # resolved value of a variable
bitbake -c cleansstate <recipe>         # force a rebuild of one recipe
bitbake -c devshell <recipe>            # shell in the recipe's build dir
bitbake -n moonforge-image-base         # dry run: what would rebuild
```

Builds are long. Run them in a Herdr pane, not the Bash tool.

## Architecture

**This repository is the kas root repo.** Everything else is a build input that
kas clones and checks out from pins in `kas/*.yml`, and is gitignored:
`meta-moonforge/`, `openembedded-core/`, `bitbake/`, plus `build/` (TOPDIR) and
`cache/` (`DL_DIR` + `SSTATE_DIR`).

In kas, a `repos:` entry with **no `url:`** is the repo holding the config file,
which kas never touches. That is the `tessaro-os:` entry. Upstream layers get a
`url`/`commit`/`branch` instead. Bumping Moonforge means changing one commit
hash in `kas/tessaro-image-base-qemux86-64.yml`.

Configuration arrives through three chains that each span several files:

1. **kas includes.** `kas/tessaro-image-base-qemux86-64.yml` pulls
   `meta-moonforge:kas/include/layer/meta-moonforge-*.yml`. Each *layer*
   fragment activates its layer, pulls the *repo* fragments it needs
   (`kas/include/repo/*.yml`, which carry the url/commit pins), and contributes
   `local_conf_header` defaults. So enabling a feature is one `includes:` entry
   here, never a manual `bblayers.conf` edit - kas regenerates `build/conf/`
   on every invocation.
2. **Distro.** `meta-tessaro-distro/conf/distro/tessaro.conf` does
   `require conf/distro/moonforge.conf` and overrides only identity fields plus
   the hostname. Everything else (systemd, uninative, `OEEquivHash`,
   security flags, `linux-yocto 6.6`, `TARGET_VENDOR = "-moonforge"`) is
   inherited.
3. **Image.** `moonforge-image-base.bb` in meta-moonforge is just
   `inherit moonforge-image`; `moonforge-image.bbclass` inherits `core-image`
   and sets `read-only-rootfs`, `overlayfs-etc`, `splash`, the `ext4 wic.bz2`
   fstypes and the `IMAGE_NAME`/`IMAGE_VERSION_SUFFIX` scheme.

**Where product changes go:** system-wide policy in `tessaro.conf`; packages and
image features in `meta-tessaro-distro/recipes-core/images/moonforge-image-base.bbappend`.
The image recipe itself stays upstream's - do not fork it.

## Gotchas

* **runqemu needs a file path, not an image name.** `runqemu ... qemux86-64
  moonforge-image-base wic` fails with `IMAGE_LINK_NAME wasn't set`: the image
  name is treated as a lazy rootfs, and the machine argument makes runqemu run
  `bitbake -e` with no recipe target, where `IMAGE_LINK_NAME` (set by the
  recipe-scope `image-artifact-names.bbclass`) does not exist. Pass the
  `.rootfs.wic` path instead - that is what the `run` tasks do.
* **KVM inside the kas container** needs `-e GROUP_ID=$(stat -c %g /dev/kvm)`,
  not `--group-add`: the entrypoint's `gosu builder` rebuilds supplementary
  groups from the container's `/etc/group`, so only the primary gid survives.
* **The build host is headless.** `nographic` is the default for `run`; use
  `run-vnc` plus an SSH tunnel if you need the framebuffer. The base image only
  ships psplash, so there is little to see until a graphics layer is added.
* **`DISTROOVERRIDES` is `tessaro`, not `moonforge`.** Any `VAR:moonforge = ...`
  in an upstream layer silently stops applying, with no warning. There are
  currently zero such lines; re-check after a Moonforge bump or when enabling a
  new layer. Fix if needed: `DISTROOVERRIDES =. "moonforge:"` in `tessaro.conf`.
* **Artifacts are named `...-qemux86-64-0.*`** because the kas fragment sets
  `IMAGE_VERSION: "0"`. The stable symlink is `...-qemux86-64.rootfs.*`, and
  the mise tasks depend on that `.rootfs` spelling.
* **Moonforge's `STRUCTURE.md` is stale in places** - e.g. it documents the
  kiosk browser as Cog with `WAYLAND_COG_LAUNCH_URL`, but the layer now ships
  `wpe-simple-launcher` with `WPE_SIMPLE_LAUNCHER_URL`. Trust the layer sources
  over upstream docs.

## Status

`qemux86-64` works and is the development target. Raspberry Pi 4/5 and the
kiosk browser (`meta-moonforge-wpe`) are not wired up yet; both are available
as Moonforge layers and cost one `includes:` entry each.
